#Exercise 4:
#There is a string method called count that is similar to the function in the previous exercise - write an invocation that counts the number of times the letter a occurs in "banana".

print ("Prints the number of times 'a' appears in 'banana'")
value = str.count("banana", "a")
print (value)
